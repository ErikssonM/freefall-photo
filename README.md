Freefall photo viewer
===

This is a lightweight, and fast image viewer. It's build in Qt/C++ for performance, and portability.

About the project
---

This is a project for me to learn Qt and improve my C++ skills. Initially, I will produce an MVP, and then go on to implement light editing functionality.

Plan for MVP
---

- Open image/folder, common filetypes
- Display images with pan/zoom functionality
- Menu bar + key bindings
- Thumbnail bar

Future feature ideas
---

- File I/O in separate thread
- Zip selected images
- Light editing (contrast, blurring, etc.)
- Blur detection
